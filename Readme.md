Adds a new slime generation with a better and more fun slime mechanic, and adds a new variety of the gelatinous characters you love... or hate.

List of all Slimes (always changing so might be outdated):
* Blue - spawns everywhere. - easy
* Red - spawns everywhere. - medium
* Yellow - spawns everywhere. - hard
* Purple - spawns everywhere. - very hard
* Black - spawns in caves. 
* Jungle - spawns in jungles. 
* Ice - spawns in snowy biomes. 
* Sand - spawns in dry biomes. 
* Spectral - spawns in the End.
* King Slime - spawns randomly near a player with a configurable chance each night.

Also adds 5 new colored slime balls to match. No use other than as vanilla slime ball varients.
